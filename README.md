# Create: Ponderful UI
### ðŸš§ Development roadmap ðŸš§

**Basic goals:**
- [x] Test config that always opens through Create's config manager;
- [ ] Goggle overlay colors config (background, top, bot colors) (SHOULD SYNC WITH SAME SETTING IN CREATE CONFIG);
- [ ] Goggle overlay adjustment config (a button that opens the `/create overlay` adjustment screen);
- [ ] Ponder activation progress colors config (early, late);
- [ ] Ponder UI buttons outline colors config (pressed, hovered, stale, unavailable);
- [ ] Ponder UI icons & texts colors config (different colors depending on type);
- [ ] Config UI buttons outline colors config (almost same as in Ponder UI, probably);
- [ ] Config UI icons & texts colors config (almost same as in Ponder UI as well, probably);
- [ ] ...

**Additional goals:**
- [ ] ARGB color picker, either for every color-related config, or mutual for all of them opening by pressing some button on the screen);
- [ ] Ponder activation progress symbol config ("|" by default);
- [ ] ...
